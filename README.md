GitHub Actions pipelines catalog
================================

Shared pipelines designed like in Jenkins X.

## starters

Everytime, when a new repository is created a structure from `packs/{{ technology name }}` should be copied into a fresh repository.

## pipelines

Shared pipelines are synchronized by running a pipeline "synchronize.yaml" manually from GitHub Actions panel.

### Usage and contributions

Feel free to use our pipelines in your projects, we are making those pipelines as generic as it is possible.
